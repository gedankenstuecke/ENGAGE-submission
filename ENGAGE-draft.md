# Speeding up the progress of biomedicine by making data reusable through crowdsourcing

## The State of Data in Biomedical Sciences
The quantity of data which is collected for biomedical research and diagnostics has exponentionally increased over the last years. At the same time, the focus on which data gets collected has shifted drastically. Traditionally biomedical research as well as health records focussed on the history of diseases in an individual, accompanied with medical imaging and diagnostics through means like tissue samples, blood tests etc. There is a growing trend to supplement this data with a wide array of genetic information, which is likely to increase over the next years.   
Over ten years have passed since the first human genome was fully sequenced. While some of the claims on how this will revolutionize medicine may have been exaggerated, the availability of the human genome definitely has changed the perception and research on genetic disorders [1]. The progress in sequencing-techniques has lead to the adoption of large-scale sequencing projects to diagnose genetic diseases and to find the causes of previously unknown diseases. In 2008 clinical whole-genome sequencing was applied to diagnose a 11-month old girl which showed xanthomas and very high cholesterol levels. Using this technique a known disease with an atypical presentation in this patient could be diagnosed [2]. 
In 2011 the complete exome – the parts of the human genome which encode proteins – were sequenced of a 5-year old who showed a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) with no mutations in the genes known to contribute to the disease. Whole exome sequencing lead to the discovery of previously unknown mutations, this knowledge can now be applied to diagnostics in all patients with CDG [3]. 

While those are still isolated cases these examples show how new sequencing techniques can be used in a clinical setting. This progress is made possible by a trend of increasingly dropping sequencing-prices. The price to sequence a human genome – which cost over 3 billion USD in 2000 – has dropped to less than 10.000 USD recently and is already available through companies on the mass-market [4] and other suppliers recently presented sequencers for less than 1.000 USD [5]. 
Customers can already get around 1 million markers – so called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) – of their genome tested for about 200 USD, or their complete exome sequenced for less than 1.000 USD without the need to enroll in scientific studies or visiting their physician through Direct-To-Consumer testing companies like *23andMe* [6]. These technical advances in the clinical and private setting catapult biomedical research into the age of "Big Data", with all the upcoming challenges of storing data in a meaningful way, making it accessible, putting it to use and making sense out of it [7].

## Why isn't Biomedical Data Open?
Although some research projects like the annotation of the EHEC causing Escherichia coli-strain apply open data and crowdsourcing principles [8] this sharing of data unfortunately still isn't a widespread practice in biomedical research – especially in studies which enlist human participants – for a couple of reasons, including ethical and legal constraints as well as the prevailing rather closed culture of this field [9]. On the cultural side researchers still fear losing control over usage of the data and thus can't publish more findings – especially as there are no standard mechanisms to cite data – while those publications are much-needed to secure their funding. Additionally, filing of patents is a common practice in biomedical research. 
Some example ethical and legal issues that come with the creation of large quantities of DNA sequence data are whether researchers should share the raw data with the participants of their studies, let alone the rest of the world, and whether they should share incidental findings about diseases or non-paternity with research participants. 

The amount of sharing data with third parties in a traditional research setting is usually not only limited directly through laws but also by institutional review boards (IRBs) or ethics committees which monitor and approve research which involves humans. Advocates of strict rules on sharing data often focus on patients' and participants' privacy, as opening up the data could easily lead to abuse of the data through law enforcement agencies, insurance companies and employers. Policy makers are working on minimizing those impacts by passing laws like the *Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act* (GINA) in the United States or the *Gendiagnosikgesetz* (GenDG) in Germany. With those policy changes in mind others argue on the side of the benefits for researchers to share data with third parties and that participants are open to share de-identified data [10]. 

A similar case can be made for sharing data with participants themselves: While some people argue that the data in the hand of individuals could do more harm than good (as they lack training in genetics to put the data to use) others make the argument that participants should have access and own their genetic information, or that ownership of this data should run in the family as those people share most of their genetic information [11].  

Sharing incidental findings with research participants is another ethics conflict in human genetics research right now: Opponents of sharing those incidental findings over the course of a study argue that the research settings often does not obey to the same rigor in handling the samples. Thus, samples could be accidentally swapped and the wrong person receives the diagnosis. Additionally, findings made in a bleeding edge research-setting have a higher chance of being preliminary, thus creating false positives which are to be falsified by more research [12]. In a nutshell, sharing incidental findings with the research participants might cause unnecessary harm. 
Proponents of sharing incidental findings see a moral responsibility to share those findings with participants, as they can have a profound impact on participants [13]. One example is the case of a woman who participated in research on the deadly Ogden-syndrome. As she was pregnant, scientists knew due to her genome sequencing that she had a 50% chance of passing the syndrome on to her unborn son. She passed the disease mutations to her boy, and the researchers did not inform either of the inheritance [14].    

The practice of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing is also critized in terms of bioethics. Some criticize that giving people the results of genetic tests without appropriate genetic counseling which would analyze how accurate those results are and would make sense of the results, to put them into perspective and what actions might be appropriate after doing the test can do more harm than good [15]. Since these concerns arose, some studies have looked into the matter and found out that most customers of such tests are able to adapt to the information provided and many show no sustained behavioral change as a result of taking DTC genetic testing [16].

## Drawbacks of Closed Data & Benefits of Open Data
All those concerns about bioethics and privacy are important points which have to be kept in mind in any approach which tries to open up data in biomedical sciences. The number of complete genome sequences is rising as is the number of people who have underwent DTC genetic testing (*23andMe* already reported ~100.000 customers in mid 2011 [17]). Besides of the few reference genomes much of this data will be kept behind lock and key on the harddrives of researchers and physicians, as well as the genotyping data of companies like *23andMe*. We feel that one should keep in mind that the lack of access comes at a cost: Reusing this data isn't easily – if at all – possible. Recognizing disease-causing mutations often needs data of multiple individuals and especially for rare conditions it is hard to get enough participants enrolled in studies. 

In extreme cases this leads to an odd ratio of researchers to participants in the corresponding study: A study published in 2011 with about 180 authors on the genetic foundation for being underweight and eating disorders had a sample size of 138 participants. The reason for this strange researcher/participant ratio lies in the low percentage of carriers of those mutations [18]. Another example are the exome sequencing results of the 5-year old with with CDG where the raw data could be put to use by other researchers also working on the same disease [3]. Opening up those resources would allow more people to participate in the research and would allow them to add their own data to unite data sets in order to get better results. Similarly biomedical data which has been created in a clinical setting for diagnostics could be put to broader use if there was a way to share genetic and more traditional biomedical information, like results of blood tests etc. 

The same is true for the results of DTC genetic testing. SNP data as produced by DTC companies gets frequently used in Genome Wide Association Studies, a method to find genetic associations where large sample sizes are crucial in order to find significant associations between different diseases and traits and the genetic variations because of the multiple testing one performs [19]. These tests could be drastically improved by opening up already collected genetic and biomedical information to incrementially increase the sample sizes. 

A drawback of concerns about bioethics and the closed access policies applied up to now is that patients or research participants and researchers nowadays are largely alienated from each other. For the most part, participants in research are reduced to a completely passive role. Former genetic counselor Misha Angrist critizes this lack of exchange between reseachers and researchee as being against research's own interest [20], as it fuels the lack of support for science and cuts in funding. Opening up data to participants (and possible a wider audience) together with increasing the exchange between those groups helps to counter these effects. 

## Solutions and Examples for Open Data
An elegant way to open data in the biomedical community, while keeping the ethical problems in mind, is to crowdsource the data collection to the people who are the ones who have to deal with the consequences of making the data available: The participants and patients themselves. This approach stops treating them as passive participants, but instead engages them as central agents in promoting scientific progress. We believe that individuals who enroll as participants in studies should get access to the raw data – DNA sequences, results of lab diagnostics and tissue samples etc. – which has been created through their participation. Participants and patients should not only have their privacy protected but should also be allowed to make an informed decision whether they want to receive and/or share their data with third parties. There is already a small number of projects which embrace this style of open data for biomedical applications. 

One of this projects is *PatientsLikeMe* which works mainly with information found in traditional health records. Patients can sign up to the website and share details about their diseases, the symptoms they have and how good different drugs work for them with the community. Over 130.000 patients have signed up so far. This not only allows patients to empower themselves by learning from each other, but the data can also be used for research purposes. *PatientsLikeMe* has published some articles on research done with their data so far. For example, *PatientsLikeMe* did a study on the off-label use (using drugs for purposes for which they have not been officially approved yet) of Modafinil [21]. They also did a study about the effects of taking lithium carbonate to slow down the progress of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): After an independent study of 16 treated patients and 28 controls found that lithium carbonate could slow down ALS, *PatientsLikeMe* did a study with 149 treated patients and 447 matched controls that could not replicate the effect [22]. As these studies are not double-blind randomized control trials they can't substitute the traditional research; however, this type of study can be a quick and cheap additional tool to evaluate drugs. A similar approach is pursued by *Genomera* [23], a recent start-up which works on small-scale studies where not only the data-collection is crowd-sourced to its users but also the concepts of the different trials are collaboratively designed. Additionally they also allow to utilize genetic information in form of DTC testing results.    

There are also projects working more extensively with genetic information. One of these projects is the *Personal Genome Project* (PGP) [24] which tries to enroll 100.000 participants who are willing to share their complete genome – which will be sequenced through the PGP along with medical records and further phenotypic information. 
Another project that tries to work with genetic information is the one we are working on, *openSNP* [25]. The project enables customers of DTC genetic testing to upload the raw results, which they received from their DTC provider along with self-reported phenotypic information about traits and diseases. Instead of relying on predefined categories for diseases, clinical lab results etc. *openSNP* crowdsources these categories as well to make it easy for users (patients/DTC customers as well as researchers) to add new phenotypes. The goal of this approach is to collect enough genetic information, together with self-reported phenotypic data, to enable Genome Wide Association Studies at basically no cost: the users themselves payed for the genotypings and are providing information about their diseases on their own. A similar approach is done by *23andMe*. Their customers can opt in to become part of their research and take questionnaires about different phenotypic traits. *23andMe* performs Association Studies with the genetic and phenotypic information and already published new findings on Parkinson's Disease using this approach [26].

## Challenges of this approach to open up biomedical data
The results of *PatientsLikeMe* and *23andMe* show that it is possible to perform studies using self-reported and crowdsourced data. Still some challenges remain to make this approach feasible for more scientists. First of all there is the question on **how open the current approaches really are.** While the data of the PGP and *openSNP* is released as Creative Commons Zero to enable a complete reuse of the data this isn't the case right now for *Genomera*, *23andMe* and *PatientsLikeMe*. While *23andMe* offers customers to download their own genetic information there is currently no way to make the data and questionnaire-answers open for everybody on their platform. *PatientsLikeMe* is a for-profit company which sells access to their data along with bonus features like creating own, IRB-approved questionnaires to paying researchers while *Genomera* has not made any statements on their business model yet. 

Another point that needs work in order to make models like this work is **the process of informed consent**. Opening up data needs a sound way of making sure that users who opt to share their biomedical and genetical information with a broader audience understand the risks which are attached in doing so. This is equally important for scientists who want to make sure they only use data of participants who gave consent in this kind of research. To solve this problem the PGP offers its own IRB approved consent form, but traditionally there is no portable standard for informed consent. A project that currently tries to create a portable consent process is **Consent To Research** [27] in collaboration with **Sage Bionetworks** [28]. 

To facilitate those changes the research community should help in creating repositories where patients and participants in research can upload their data using open licenses. Similarly, the community needs to address the problem of incompatible ethics approvals. Additionally policy-makers need to address the challenges of making biomedical data available by protecting patients and researchees who opt to make data available.

Last but not least there has to be a change in scientific culture in Biomedicine. Away from the traditional secrecy and being passive and towards a more open attitude which embraces a relationship with research participants. We are confident that this change in culture will come over the next years, not out of pure altruism, but because every researcher will benefit from open data in the long run. On the side of patients there are already the first few groups which work on this, like the *Society for Participatory Medicine* [29]. As Misha Angrist wrote: «If biomedical science remains an “us and them” proposition, it bodes well neither for us nor for them.»
